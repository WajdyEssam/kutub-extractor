Quick and dirty code to fetch all books from http://kutub.info

To compile and run this program from command line:

Compile: javac -cp .;libs\* Demo.java
Run: java .;libs\* Demo > output.txt

the above line redirect all console output to output.txt
when finishing the scrapping you may find some files not downloaded and this because either the link 
is not exist on the website, or there was some problems on your connection
so you can re-download it by calling reDownloadFiles("output.txt")
and this will re-download all files that is not downloaded when you  run the application first time

books_links.txt contains all books links for direct download by using browser

To Do list:
------------
 * design UI for this code
 * add logging and remove the need of output redirection
 * add multi threading (something like producer-consumer pattern)
 * add pause/stop features when downloading
 * remove libs from code and add Maven support
